#  shopiAngular - README
Welcome to shopiAngular, a modern eCommerce web application built using the MERN stack with TypeScript! shopiAngular aims to provide users with a seamless shopping experience, offering a diverse range of products while ensuring fast loading times and a responsive design. This README will guide you through the technologies used in this project and invite developers worldwide to join me, Asoh Yannick, a full-stack developer, in building applications like this

Technologies Used
1. MERN Stack
# .MongoDB: A NoSQL database that allows for flexible data storage. It’s perfect for handling the diverse product catalog and user information in shopiAngular.

# Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, Express simplifies the process of building robust APIs. It serves as the backbone of our server-side logic.

# React.js: The front-end library responsible for building the user interface. React allows for a dynamic and responsive experience, making it easy for users to browse and purchase products.

# Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that enables us to run our server-side code using JavaScript. It provides a powerful environment for building scalable applications.
2. TypeScript

# TypeScript adds strong typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors. By using TypeScript, we ensure that our codebase is more maintainable and easier to understand, making collaboration with other developers smoother.

3. Cloudinary
To improve the performance of image uploads and ensure faster loading times, we utilize Cloudinary. This cloud-based service allows us to upload, store, and manage images efficiently. By offloading image storage to Cloudinary, we significantly reduce the load on our backend, resulting in a more responsive user experience.

4. Other Technologies
# Redux: For state management in our React application, Redux helps us manage the global state efficiently, improving the user experience.
Tailwind CSS: For styling our components, we use Styled Components, allowing us to write actual CSS in our JavaScript, making the styling process more modular and manageable.
Jest: For testing our application, Jest provides a robust framework that ensures our components and APIs work as intended.
